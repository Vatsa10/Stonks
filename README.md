Basic Prototype

The Stock Analysis and Prediction Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based application designed to empower users with actionable insights into stock market trends and performance. Built using Python's Dash framework and integrated with Yahoo Finance, the application provides real-time and historical stock data visualization, technical analysis, and predictive modeling.

The core functionality includes fetching stock data dynamically, visualizing key metrics such as closing prices, exponential moving averages (EMA), and other technical indicators. Users can also leverage a machine learning-based prediction feature to forecast stock prices for a specified number of days. The applicationâ€™s intuitive interface allows seamless interaction, with tools like date selection, stock code input, and personalized analytics.

This project emphasizes scalability, responsiveness, and user-centric design. Advanced frameworks such as Plotly enhance the visualization experience, while ML models like Support Vector Regression (SVR) ensure accurate predictions. The platform is further designed to accommodate feature expansions, such as real-time data updates and multiple stock comparisons.

Targeted at investors, analysts, and enthusiasts, the application serves as a valuable tool for making informed financial decisions. This abstract outlines the development process, which began in September 2024, and is progressing through iterative stages of prototyping, feature enhancement, and deployment, with the final submission scheduled for April 2025.
